This is the name for the complete infrastructure, composed by Equo client (textual), and Rigo client (graphical). Sabayon is based on Gentoo's testing branch, which is about on par with Debian Sid releases. Entropy takes packages from Gentoo testing and they are pre-compiled, then offered to you in binary form. There is a time delay from when Sabayon compiles these packages for Entropy and when you receive them. It is recommended to only use 1 of the package managers(either Entropy or Portage) to avoid any possible conflicts as a result of the time delay. Generally, Entropy packages will be slightly more stable because they will have already been released in Gentoo testing for a period of time(exact amount of time varies), prior to being released in Entropy. Some highlights: Gentoo Linux compatible (caution, mixing entropy and portage is for advanced users) Takes the best from Portage, Yum and APT Fast as lightning SQLite-powered (embedded) Smart and User-centric Powerful Packages: multiple packages inside one single archive (Smart Packages) Supports self-contained applications (Smart Applications) Backward Compatible Packages: they can be used in Gentoo Linux after a quick conversion Multiple branches support (each branch is a release version) Database corruptions aware: rescue and system health scanning tools included Easy to deploy and use in a Network Environment Multiple repositories aware: everyone can create one Extensible and Human Understandable API Strongest Artificial Intelligence (Entropy has a brain) Great sense of humour, and much more... Basic Usage Equo is the command line client-side application for the Entropy package management system, and should be always performed as Root. It is capable of installing, removing and updating packages, resolving dependences, reverse dependency handling and configuration file handling and that's just to start with. Basic Usage There are several options you can use when using Equo, a few of the basic commands are shown below. Searching for a package can be accomplished by running the equo search command: equo search foo To install a package use the install function, the --ask amendment is optional but recommended. equo install foo --ask To remove a package use the remove function as shown below: equo remove foo --ask To upgrade all your packages to the latest versions use this command: equo upgrade --ask As you can see from the examples above, the \"--ask\" amendment is optional, but highly recommended, as it not only gives you more information about the packages being installed, but also the dependencies that may come with them, giving you more control about what is going to be installed, followed by a confirmation/abortion of the command.

Entropy is the package manager and will be vital to know. First thing you will want to do is sort your mirrors. All commands must be run as root, so su or sudo. It is a good idea to optimize the sorting of mirrors so that all package upgrades will be downloaded as quickly as possible. The choice will depend on what repository you are using, choices are: limbo(sabayon-limbo) - main(sabayonlinux.org) - weekly(sabayon-weekly) | to see which one your system is using simply do: equo status Issue the proper command(s) according to your status equo repo mirrorsort sabayon-weekly equo repo mirrorsort sabayonlinux.org equo repo mirrorsort sabayon-limbo Now update the package lists from the mirrors equo update If you run into problems with that then try: equo update --force Once you have that completed it is vital to get Entropy upgraded to the latest version before doing a full system upgrade. Upgrade will bring your system to current development. equo install sys-apps/entropy rigo equo --relaxed If you have config files to update equo conf update Once the Entropy code is upgraded to the latest version, fully upgrade the rest of your system with these two commands: equo update To get a list of available updates and choose yes to continue updates equo upgrade --ask Follow what is happening on the screen, as Entropy will show you what it is going to do and ask for confirmations. The 'equo update' command will update the database on your PC with the latest information on packages available in the Entropy repositories; The 'equo upgrade' command will download from the repositories the binary files for new versions of packages installed on your PC and then install the new versions of those packages. Time of process depends on how many packages, bandwidth and hardware. After it is done and if you have config files to update, make sure to: equo conf update You will want to make your selection but you really should get to know your config files as they will change your system. More than likely most will select -5. I always look over the config files as I don't want some of my configs getting overwritten. The final step is to run the following commands, checking for missing dependencies and stability: equo deptest Followed by equo libtest After this has finished, reboot and enjoy your freshly installed fully updated Sabayon. There is a graphical user interface(gui) that you can use instead called Rigo. Rigo will allow you to sort your mirrors, manage repositories, do system upgrades with a click of a button and deal with config files. Get to know how to use equo incase you can't access Rigo. A Note on Repositories: Limbo - testing packages, things may break, advanced users Main - After limbo and made sure things are stable the package is moved to Main Weekly - The most stable as packages have been through limbo and main. You can manage repositories with equo or Rigo equo repo disable sabayon-limbo equo repo enable sabayon-limbo Now you're set to use equo: To install a package, the --ask amendment is optional but recommended. equo install foo --ask Removing Packages equo remove foo --ask Search for a Package equo search foo Cleanup downloaded packages Every now and then you will want to cleanup the packages that Entropy downloaded: equo cleanup See help for more equo commands equo --help","title":"Freshinstall"},{"location":"articles/howto/","text":"Desktop Environment Hardware Installation Networking | Internet Firewall - firewalld LAMP Software Management Entropy Fresh Install Software Applications System Operations User Management","title":"How To Index"},{"location":"articles/howto/#desktop-environment","text":"","title":"Desktop Environment"},{"location":"articles/howto/#hardware","text":"","title":"Hardware"},{"location":"articles/howto/#installation","text":"","title":"Installation"},{"location":"articles/howto/#networking-internet","text":"Firewall - firewalld LAMP","title":"Networking | Internet"},{"location":"articles/howto/#software-management","text":"Entropy Fresh Install","title":"Software Management"},{"location":"articles/howto/#software-applications","text":"","title":"Software Applications"},{"location":"articles/howto/#system-operations","text":"User Management","title":"System Operations"},{"location":"articles/irc/","text":"Freenode #sabayon - this is our main support channel #sabayon-dev - is our developer channel, interested in helping out with the project, come join us #sabayon-chat - general off-topic chat Support We depend on the community to help each other out and at times the irc channels can be quiet.
