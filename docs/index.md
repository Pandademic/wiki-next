# Welcome to Sabayon Linux Wiki

Sabayon Linux is based on the source-based distro named Gentoo. Gentoo is a highly customizable distro and, using Gentoo's excellent development techniques, we have created a pre-configured distribution with the tenets of Performance, Versatility, and Stability.

We are starting a fresh wiki and need your help with rebuilding material to help the Community
