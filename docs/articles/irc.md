## Support
We depend on the community to help each other out and at times the irc channels can be quiet.

* Be Polite
* Be Patient
* Respect the Operators

We are always in need of volunteers to help the community.

## Testers
We are always looking for people to test our latest stuff.  Our -dev isos are a great way to get involved with testing.

Grab your favorite dev flavored iso and try it out, report any issues

Our Limbo repo is another great way to test, simply add the repo

Report issues to our Mailing List or #sabayon-dev channel, Mailing List would probably be best, that way it won't get lost.  Please include:

* Which ISO you are using
* Your Hardware
* How to replicate
* Log Files if any or Error Messages
* Get to know [journalctl](https://www.loggly.com/ultimate-guide/using-journalctl/) for Logs

Without the above information it is really hard to track down the issue.
